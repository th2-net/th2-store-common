# th2 store common library (Java)

This project contains the storage abstract class with boilerplate code to interact with the message router from the [th2-common](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-common-j).
It also contains the utility classes to convert th2's messages and the events described in [th2-grpc-common](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-grpc-common/blob/master/src/main/proto/th2_grpc_common/common.proto "common.proto") to be compatible with th2 storage format.
